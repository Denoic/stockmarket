# Stock Market
This is a very easy to use program made in python.
You can see trending stock markets, you can research the stock. And you can track the price of the stock.

# Why should you use this?
It's more reliable.

# Where does the data come from?
It comes from Yahoo Finance Api. So if the program is slow the api latency is big. (average is 1000 ms)

# If the latency is big, wouldn't the price data be outdated?
The Price comes from their site. It's web scraped.

# When will the program be released?
It will be soon. March for sure
